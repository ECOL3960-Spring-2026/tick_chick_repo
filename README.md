# An Investigation into Abundance of Tick-borne Pathogens

## Description of Project

During this project, our team will examine how mean seasonal temperatures affect the abundance of ticks infected by pathogens in the Northeast. We have chosen this question because we are looking to explore the effects of climate change on human health and wildlife wellbeing. We chose the Northeast due to the disproportionate prevalence of tick-borne diseases in the human population compared to other regions of the United States. We chose the Southeast to compare regional differences as well as pathogen types in different regions.

Our main hypothesis is that as temperature increases, the number of ticks present in the area will increase and the proportion of ticks that are infected by a pathogen increase. Our null hypothesis is that variations in temperature have no effect on the number of ticks that are infected by a pathogen.

Our alternative hypothesis is that as as temperature increases, the abundance of ticks and the number of ticks that are infected by a pathogen increases until a certain temperature barrier where they then decrease.

To test this, we will compare data on mean seasonal temperatures at the HARV site to the proportion of ticks that were sampled that were positive for pathogens at the HARV site.

## Planned Data to Use

We plan to use these NEON datasets:

-   DP1.10092.001 - Tick pathogen status (testResult, maybe testPathogenName) This dataset will inform whether the ticks are infected by pathogens or not. -

-   DP1.00098.001 - Relative humidity (tempRHMean)

    -   Alternative: DP1.00005.001 - Biological (surface) temperature (bioTempMean) This dataset is relavent because it contains the mean temperature data which will inform us whether there is a relationship between temperature and tick pathogen status.

-   DP1.10093.001 - Ticks sampled using drag cloths (adultCount, nymphCount, larvaCount, individualCount) This dataset informs our group of the tick abundance to measure the pathogen prevalence in the tick populations.

The data includes the measures for tick pathogen status, relative humidity, (alternative) surface temperature, and ticks sampled from drag cloths. We are viewing data in site HARV because of the extensive amount of data points in this site. We are retrieving our data from NEON database to support or reject our hypothesis with existing data.
