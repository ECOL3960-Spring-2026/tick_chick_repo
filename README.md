# An Investigation into Abundance of Tick-borne Pathogens
Code and data storage for the TickChick group's ECOL3960 project
## Planned Data to Use
We plan to use these NEON datasets:
· DP1.10092.001 - Tick pathogen status (testResult, maybe testPathogenName)
· DP1.00098.001 - Relative humidity (tempRHMean)
	· Alternative: DP1.00005.001 - Biological (surface) temperature (bioTempMean)
· DP1.10093.001 - Ticks sampled using drag cloths (adultCount, nymphCount, larvaCount, individualCount) 
The data includes the measures of data for tick pathogen status, relative humidity, (alternative) surface temperature, and ticks sampled from drag cloths. We are viewing data in site HARV. We are retrieving our data from NEON database.
