# An Investigation into Abundance of Tick-borne Pathogens: Code and data storage for the TickChick group's ECOL3960 project


## Description of Project
During this project, our team will examine how mean seasonal temperatures affect the abundance of ticks infected by pathogens in the Northeast. We have chosen this question because we are looking to explore the effects of climate change on human health and wildlife wellbeing. We chose the Northeast due to the disproportionate prevalence of tick-borne diseases in the human population compared to other regions of the United States. Our main hypothesis is that as temperature increases, the number of ticks that are infected by a pathogen will increase. Our null hypothesis is that variations in temperature have no effect on the number of ticks that are infected by a pathogen. Our alternative hypothesis is that as temperature decreases, the number of ticks that are infected by a pathogen will increase. To test this, we will compare data on mean seasonal temperatures at the HARV site to the proportion of ticks that were sampled that were positive for pathogens at the HARV site.


## Planned Data to Use
We plan to use these NEON datasets:
· DP1.10092.001 - Tick pathogen status (testResult, maybe testPathogenName)
· DP1.00098.001 - Relative humidity (tempRHMean)
	· Alternative: DP1.00005.001 - Biological (surface) temperature (bioTempMean)
· DP1.10093.001 - Ticks sampled using drag cloths (adultCount, nymphCount, larvaCount, individualCount) 
The data includes the measures of data for tick pathogen status, relative humidity, (alternative) surface temperature, and ticks sampled from drag cloths. We are viewing data in site HARV. We are retrieving our data from NEON database.
